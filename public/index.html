      <h1 title="Nice to meet you! I'm the hover text, what's your name?">Hi!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a high-school junior in California. I like to code visual simulations and build frontend sites. I love high performance, clean, well
        structured code. Click on the items below to see what I have learned from working in these programming languages.
      </p>

      <div>
        <details>
          <summary>TypeScript, HTML & CSS</summary>
          <p>
            I've worked on multiple large TypeScript & React projects (TSX & JSX), and I love to keep up with the latest frontend trends and news.
            I've learned about synchronous reactive programming through SolidJS and functional programming through Angular & RxJs. I'm also
            experienced in writing NodeJS servers, WebGL, and have been learning about edge computing.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Rust</summary>
          <p>
            I'm super excited about things like WebGPU and other graphical frameworks, and Rust's tools for graphics and game dev are awesome. I've
            also written a few web servers in Rust (including a pretty neat reverse shell).
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Scala & Java</summary>
          <p>
            I developed a massively multiplayer .io browser game in Scala called Snowy. I have also learned data structures and algorithms in Java,
            and taken the AP Computer Science test.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>C#</summary>
          <p>I worked on a large C# codebase where I learned about databases like PostgreSQL, as well as things like dependency injection and SSO.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Python</summary>
          <p>
            I've taught an 8 week Advanced Python course for students at Robotics for All covering things like object oriented programming, binary
            trees, and algorithms using stacks and queues.

      <h1>Simulations</h1>
      <p>
        I have made hundreds of fun little simulation projects to improve my programming skills. I've put a few below and many more are available at
        <a href="https://cm-ht.ml">CM-Tech</a>, a name I use on projects that I build with my friend <a href="https://ckissane.github.io">Cole</a>.

          <div>
            <h2>Traffic dots</h2>
            <p>
              A fun project where dots move randomly semi locked to a grid. They bump into each other and you can click to repel or attract them,
              depending on the setting.

            <h2>Car Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              This project uses the planck.js physics engine to simulate cars that evolve to drive through a course. Heavily inspired by
              <a href="http://boxcar2d.com">BoxCar2D</a>.

            <h2>Boids</h2>
            <p>
              Boids is a term coined by Craig Reynolds that is used to describe objects which flock in groups. This project simulates boids shaped
              like caterpillars.
