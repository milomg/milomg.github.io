        I'm a California based programmer. For fun I like to code visual simulations, build frontend sites, and write the occasional Rust server. I
        love high performance, clean, and well structured code. Click on the items below to see more about my work in these programming languages.

          <summary>TypeScript, HTML & CSS</summary>
          <p>
            I've worked on multiple large TypeScript & React projects (TSX & JSX), and I love to keep up with the latest frontend trends and news. For
            hobby projects, I sometimes recommend synchronous reactive programming through SolidJS, but for larger organizations, React is usually the
            way to go. I'm also experienced in writing NodeJS servers, WebGL, and Angular.

          <p>
            I'm super excited about things like WebGPU and other graphical frameworks, and Rust's tools for graphics and game dev are awesome. I've
            also written a few web servers in Rust (including a pretty neat reverse shell).

            I worked on a large microservices project that included RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, where I wrote C# services with dependency injection, SSO,
            and PostgreSQL.

      <h1>Simulations</h1>
      <p>
        I have made over a hundred fun little simulation projects. I've put a few below and many more are available at
        <a href="https://cm-ht.ml">CM-Tech</a>, a name I use on projects that I build with my friend <a href="https://ckissane.github.io">Cole</a>.

          <div>
            <h2>Traffic dots</h2>
            <p>
              A fun project where dots move randomly semi locked to a grid. They bump into each other and you can click to repel or attract them,
              depending on the setting.

            <h2>Car Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              This project uses the planck.js physics engine to simulate cars that evolve to drive through a course. Heavily inspired by
              <a href="http://boxcar2d.com">BoxCar2D</a>.

            <p>
              Boids is a term coined by Craig Reynolds that is used to describe objects which flock in groups. This project simulates boids shaped
              like caterpillars.
