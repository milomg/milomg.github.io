## Self-adjusting computation (SAC)

Self-adjusting computation is a framework for incremental computation, where the goal is to efficiently recompute a program's output across changes to its input by reusing unchanged intermediate results.

- [Self adjusting computation papers](https://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation)
  - (there are many good papers here, but the original dissertation and the imperative one are recommended)
- Incremental ([talk](https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/seven-implementations-of-incremental/), [library docs](https://opensource.janestreet.com/incremental/)). A production-quality OCaml library for SAC, which tackles a ton of performance and usability issues not dealt with in the academic literature. Highlights:
  - GC safety without manual disposal or finalizers, by making sure "unnecessary" nodes (those that aren't currently being transitively observed) aren't retained by the framework.
  - A clever way of efficiently maintaining a topological ordering on a dependency graph that can change dynamically, assigning each node a _height_ that can increase but never decrease.
  - Dynamic dependencies are opt-in, which they found important for performance (no tracking overhead when rerunning nodes whose dependencies won't ever change).
- Adapton ([website](http://adapton.org/), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07792)): rust, ocaml, and even [python](https://bitbucket.org/khooyp/adapton.python/src/main/) versions.
  - _Nominal_ Adapton introduces "names" as a mechanism to reuse previous results even if the structure of the computation changes and shuffles things around.
  - Fungi ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07826)) provides a type system for Nominal Adapton, helpful because the restrictions on the correct use of names are rather tricky.
- Salsa ([docs](https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/overview.html), [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY)) the reactive system powering some of Rust's IDE support.
  - Doing this in Rust has some complications (have to declare interfaces for everything) and some neat benefits (macros; automatically deriving traits; letting the type system forbid setting a signal from within a computation).
  - Everything is declared up front (no closures or anonymous computations) so serialization is on the table.
- Anchors ([explainer post](https://lord.io/spreadsheets/))
  - Tries to combine some of the implementation tricks of Incremental and Adapton. Offers a straightforward explanation of the design space with illustrations.

The most widely applicable takeaway from this line of research is a definition of "from-scratch consistency" as the notion of correctness for incremental computation.

## Build systems

Somewhat like self-adjusting computation, a build system (think: `make`) is concerned with reusing past work to deliver a final set of outputs.

- Build Systems Ã  la Carte ([paper](https://ndmitchell.com/downloads/paper-build_systems_a_la_carte_theory_and_practice-21_apr_2020.pdf), [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-dqYqg3kY), [slides](https://ndmitchell.com/downloads/slides-distributed_build_systems-18_may_2018.pdf)). Develops a pluggable framework for decomposing the design space of build systems (defined very loosely: Excel is a build system in their framework) into orthogonal choices. The two major choices they consider:
  - Deciding what order to rerun/recheck tasks (the "scheduler")
  - Determining whether or not a given task needs to be rerun (the "rebuilder").

Many concepts here are cross-applicable to other types of reactivity, and the idea of a pluggable framework is very powerful for unifying different systems into a broader umbrella.

## Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

FRP is a broad class of _dataflow_-centered approaches to interactive/reactive programming. It treats inputs and outputs as _streams of events_ rather than as individual values, and provides combinators for producing, consuming, and transforming such streams. FRP systems often (but not always) include a distinction between time-varying "signals" (or "behaviors") whose current value can be observed at any time, and "events" which occur only at discrete times.

FRP systems -- as expected of a stream-processing formalism -- allow future outputs to depend on the entire history of the program, not just the current inputs.

- FrTime ([paper](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/ck-frtime/paper.pdf), [library docs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/frtime/)). An early FRP system in Scheme. Makes _everything_ reactive.
  - Defines "glitch-freeness", which because of FRP's history-dependence is a trickier notion than SAC's "from-scratch consistency".
- [Deprecating the Observer Pattern with Scala.React](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/176887/files/DeprecatingObservers2012.pdf), a recognizably modern Signals library... from 2012!
  - One of the earlier _imperative_ dataflow languages, with auto-tracking of dependencies and no eDSL or compiler support required.

## Implicits & scope-respecting operations

Practical reactive systems sometimes include features that involve propagating information down or up the nesting hierarchy, such as `Context`, `Suspense`, or error handlers. Reactivity brings some unique complications here, but the non-reactive versions of these features are reasonably well-studied and can provide a behavioral guideline.

- [Programming with Implicit Values, Functions, and Control](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/programming-with-implicit-values-functions-and-control-or-implicit-functions-dynamic-binding-with-lexical-scoping/) (paper). Provides a blueprint for the (from-scratch) semantics of language features that involve reading from or interacting with the scoped/dynamic context.
- [Dynamic scoping is an effect, implicit parameters are a coeffect](http://blog.ezyang.com/2020/08/dynamic-scoping-is-an-effect-implicit-parameters-are-a-coeffect/) (blog post). Talks about complications of dynamic scope/implicit parameters in a lazy language; similar complications exist for reactive systems (both complicate the notion of "the call stack").

## Algebraic Effects

Might be tangential; might be very relevant if JS had algebraic effects as a feature. The concept can nevertheless guide certain bits of reactive system design, if you restrict yourself to "immediately tail-resumptive" effects (that don't require suspending the call stack to resume it later).

- Algebraic effects
  - [Short talk aimed at JS developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrBq8R_kxI0), relating algebraic effects to more familiar notions like exceptions, `yield`, and async/await.
  - In WASM ([proposal](https://wasmfx.dev/)); in OCaml ([docs](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/effects.html), [talk](https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/effective-programming/)).
