          I'm a student at University of Toronto who loves to code. In my free time, I make graphical simulations, build frontend sites, and write the
          occasional Rust server. I carefully craft high performance, clean, and well structured code. Click on the items below to see more about my
          work in different programming languages and environments.

            <p>
              I've worked on multiple very large TypeScript & React projects, and I love to keep up with the latest frontend trends and news. I'm a
              core team member on SolidJS, where I lead the Solid Playground and DevTools teams. I'm also experienced in writing NodeJS servers,
              WebGL, and Angular.

            <p>
              I'm super excited about things like WebGPU and other graphical frameworks, and Rust's tools for graphics and game dev are awesome. I've
              also written a few web servers in Rust (including a pretty neat reverse shell).

            <p>
              I developed a massively multiplayer .io browser game in Scala called Snowy. This project taught me about build tools, profiling, and
              functional programming.

            <p>
              I worked on a large microservices project that included RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, where I wrote C# services with .NET Core and OAuth. My
              work involved building SSO and replacing SQL Server with PostgreSQL on a document management system used by thousands of lawyers.

              I teach an 8 week Advanced Python course for students at Robotics for All. I've also used Python to develop a webserver using FastAPI

        <h1>Simulations</h1>
        <p>
          I have made over a hundred fun little simulation projects. I've put a few below and many more are available at
          <a href="https://cm-ht.ml">CM-Tech</a>, a name I use on projects that I build with my friend <a href="https://ckissane.github.io">Cole</a>.

              <h2>Traffic dots</h2>
              <p>
                A fun project where dots move randomly semi locked to a grid. They bump into each other and you can click to repel or attract them,
                depending on the setting.

              <h2>Car Evolution</h2>
              <p>
                This project uses the planck.js physics engine to simulate cars that evolve to drive through a course. Heavily inspired by
                <a href="http://boxcar2d.com">BoxCar2D</a>.

              <h2>Boids</h2>
              <p>
                Boids is a term coined by Craig Reynolds that is used to describe objects which flock in groups. This project simulates boids shaped
                like caterpillars.
