          I'm a California based programmer. For fun, I like to code visual simulations, build frontend sites, and write the occasional Rust server. I
          love high performance, clean, and well structured code. Click on the items below to see more about my work in these programming languages.

            <summary>TypeScript, HTML & CSS</summary>
            <p>
              I've worked on multiple large TypeScript & React projects (TSX & JSX), and I love to keep up with the latest frontend trends and news.
              Iâ€™ve written some small projects using alternate approaches like synchronous reactive programming through SolidJS, but for larger
              organizations, React is the way to go. I'm also experienced in writing NodeJS servers, WebGL, and Angular.

            <summary>Rust</summary>
            <p>
              I'm super excited about things like WebGPU and other graphical frameworks, and Rust's tools for graphics and game dev are awesome. I've
              also written a few web servers in Rust (including a pretty neat reverse shell).

            <summary>Scala & Java</summary>
            <p>
              I developed a massively multiplayer .io browser game in Scala called Snowy. This project taught me a lot about build tools, profiling,
              and functional programming.

            <p>
              I worked on a large microservices project that included RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, where I wrote C# services with .NET Core, dependency
              injection, and OAuth. My recent work was adding SSO and replacing SQL Server with PostgreSQL on an existing document management system
              used by thousands of lawyers.

        <h1>Simulations</h1>
        <p>
          I have made over a hundred fun little simulation projects. I've put a few below and many more are available at
          <a href="https://cm-ht.ml">CM-Tech</a>, a name I use on projects that I build with my friend <a href="https://ckissane.github.io">Cole</a>.

              <h2>Traffic dots</h2>
              <p>
                A fun project where dots move randomly semi locked to a grid. They bump into each other and you can click to repel or attract them,
                depending on the setting.

              <h2>Car Evolution</h2>
              <p>
                This project uses the planck.js physics engine to simulate cars that evolve to drive through a course. Heavily inspired by
                <a href="http://boxcar2d.com">BoxCar2D</a>.

              <h2>Boids</h2>
              <p>
                Boids is a term coined by Craig Reynolds that is used to describe objects which flock in groups. This project simulates boids shaped
                like caterpillars.
